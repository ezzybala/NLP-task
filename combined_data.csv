A1    Sadness and anger pervaded the crowd that gathered outside the house in Little Havana, in Miami, where Elian was taken shortly after being found at sea in an inner tube in November and where he lived during most of the custody battle.   A14    Russia Unveils Economic Plan  The Kremlin issued its long-awaited plan to overhaul Russia's economy. It would slash subsidies that have held down utility rates, devise a new energy policy and wipe out unpaid wages, tax breaks and other obligations that sap government spending power. The announcement almost overshadowed another major event: a vote in Parliament's upper house against President Vladimir V. Putin's plan to effectively disband it.   A6    U.S. and Russian Missile Plan  Russia and the United States will hold a joint defense exercise against short- and medium-range missiles, an American official said.

A9    Iraqi Storms U.N. Office  An Iraqi man brandishing two machine guns and explosives shot his way into a United Nations office in Baghdad, Iraq, killing 2 people, wounding 7 and taking about 50 hostage.

A1    Boy Scouts Can Bar Gays  The Supreme Court, ruling 5 to 4 in a New Jersey case, said the Boy Scouts may exclude gay members because opposition to homosexuality is part of their ''expressive message.''

He didn’t want our conversation to feel like one, he said, raising both hands in a gesture of innocence, like a magician showing there was nothing up his sleeve. But once he planted the suggestion, it wouldn’t go away. There was the register of his voice, oscillating between breathy and enthusiastic, and the complete absence of qualifiers to soften his bold claims. And then there were the wares clustered on the table in front of him. He had laid out cups of his signature product, Bulletproof Coffee, which is made with grass-fed butter and Brain Octane, a trademarked oil extracted from coconuts. Next to the cups lay Bulletproof-branded protein bars in chocolate and vanilla. ‘‘I am not plugging my stuff,’’ he said with a semi-embarrassed laugh. ‘‘I’m just talking about how things work.’’"

The Moral Life of Babies,Can they really tell right from wrong? What researchers are cooing about. ,"Not long ago, a team of researchers watched a 1-year-old boy take justice into his own hands. The boy had just seen a puppet show in which one puppet played with a ball while interacting with two other puppets.

At this point, the toddler was asked to take a treat away from one puppet. Like most children in this situation, the boy took it from the pile of the “naughty” one. But this punishment wasn’t enough — he then leaned over and smacked the puppet in the head."

The War for the Rainforest,"Set aside for an isolated Indigenous group, the Brazilian preserve Ituna-Itatá has now been heavily deforested — a grim illustration of the intractable forces destroying the Amazon.","On a sweltering afternoon in the wilds of the Brazilian Amazon, Edward Luz rode on the back of a motorbike into a forest clearing to confront a squad of combat-armed environmental police who, for their own safety, had helicoptered in. Luz is an anthropologist, a tall, powerfully built man of 43. He is a right-wing activist and, figuratively speaking, a hired gun. On that February afternoon in 2020, he wore tinted prescription sunglasses, a bushy beard and a radical haircut close-cropped on the sides. He did not have access to a helicopter. To get to the clearing, he traveled for eight hours by a ferry crossing and down muddy tracks from Altamira, a small city in the state of Pará on the far side of the wide brown Xingu river."
